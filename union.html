    <h1>Building Your Union</h1>

        The first and hardest step of organizing your co-workers is talking to them.
        Your first goal, as an orgainizer, should be identifying who might share your
        passion for making your workplace better. Have lots of conversations about
        work (you probably already do) and find out what people care about---how
        do your friends want to see your environment change? Also keep in mind
        who will make a good <em>organizer</em>. Everyone will get involved eventually,
        and it's good to keep a mental list of what is important to everyone, but at
        early stages you need to focus on growing your reach. Nobody can build a union
        alone!
      </p>
      <p>
        Something you definitely want to avoid is becoming a 'union guy' at this
        point. Just take every opportunity to plant the seeds in peoples' minds.
        <i>What would you change about work if you could? Do you think that admin
        will ever make the changes you want to see? Did you hear what happened to
        so-and-so? I wish we could have helped them.</i> After a few conversations,
        you'll have a feel of whether you should say the word 'union' or not with a particular person. That's
        when you invite them to the organizing meetings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our first meetings were in cheap bars where everyone could get a beer. This was
        fine at first, but eventually you want them to stop feeling like a hang-out
        and start feeling like work. The first thing you need is a list of graduate
        students at your university. This can be harder to get than you might expect!
        At OHSU, there is no good, continuously updated, publicly available directory of
        employees. We mostly worked with a list I scraped from the employee directory.
        It was out of date, and I had to write a (pretty horrendous) script to deal
        with it, but it's better than nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you have a list, start assigning people. Eventually, you'll want 10%
        of your bargaining unit to be involved in the organizational aspect, since
        any more than that and people start to be spread out too thin. Have a meeting
        where everyone takes a group of people they're responsible for <em>and will
        be for the forseeable future</em>. This point is key---you need to keep talking
        to people! Someone you might think is a yes one week will have a bad conversation
        with someone they know whose parent was in a union in 1980 and they're a no all
        of a sudden. Keep checking in!
      </p>
      <p>
        Around this point, you'll want to start contacting unions you think you'd
        like to work with. I'd recommend finding one that is, at least in theory,
        democratically set up. You don't want someone who has never seen a test tube
        setting priorities for your labwork job. You'll definitely want someone who's
        willing to assign you an organizer, part-time at first, but once you start
        to get past the initial hurdle (for us I think it was around 15 or 20 people?)
        you'd want someone full-time dedicated to keeping things organized and moving.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you've got your organizer (or even your committee), stop listening to
        me! They know what to do better than me---this is just how we ended up going
        about things. However, you can always shoot me an email, twitter DM, or
        even a letter about this type of stuff. I strongly believe that making our
        universities better, safer places for all to do their research makes better
        science!
