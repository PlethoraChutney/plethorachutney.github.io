        I'm a graduate student at OHSU, in the <a href="https://www.ohsu.edu/xd/research/centers-institutes/vollum/faculty/baconguislab.cfm">Baconguis lab</a>.
        We work on structural biochemistry, specifically cryoEM of ion channels. Check
        out our <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/39340">recent paper</a> on the structure of ENaC!
        I'm currently focused on getting my bearings on my project, doing background reading,
        and writing some probably-unneccessary scripts to make data analysis easier
        down the road. My interest and talent in coding are purely recreational,
        and the only thing I've written that folks in my lab use right now are
        my <a href="https://github.com/PlethoraChutney/HPLC_Scripts">HPLC analysis scripts</a>.

        I've got a <a href="https://twitter.com/posertinlab">science twitter</a>, that's about the only science social media I do.
        I also am pretty heavily involved in our new <a href="https://gradworkersunited.org/">grad student union</a>.
        I was one of the first organizers, and it's been so inspiring (and challenging)
        helping grow it from a few of us whining at a bar to something that takes
        everyones thoughts into account and works to make OHSU a better place to
        study.
