        I'm a graduate student at OHSU, in the <a href="https://www.ohsu.edu/xd/research/centers-institutes/vollum/faculty/baconguislab.cfm">Baconguis lab</a>.
        We work on structural biochemistry, specifically cryoEM of ion channels. Check
        out our <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/39340">recent paper</a> on the structure of ENaC!

        If you do any chromatography, you might be interested in my
        <a href="https://github.com/PlethoraChutney/HPLC_Scripts">HPLC analysis scripts</a>.
        They're written for a Waters HPLC, because that's what we have, but if you
        submit an issue along with an example output file of your HPLC I'd be
        happy to take a look.

      <p>
        I've got a <a href="https://twitter.com/posertinlab">science twitter</a>, and
        I'm also involved in our new <a href="https://gradworkersunited.org/">grad student union</a>.
        I was one of the first organizers, and it's been so inspiring (and challenging)
        helping grow it from a few of us whining at a bar to something that takes
        everyones thoughts into account and works to make OHSU a better place to
        study. If you have any questions about forming a union at your university
        (or any other place of work) please feel free to send me an email!
